Aldryn Search
#############

Aldryn Search is an application that acts like a bridge between django-haystack and django-cms.
It's also a great tool to hookup search capabilities to any django app, especially apps that make use of
multilingual frameworks like django-hvad or django-parler. It's designed with multiple languages in mind,
and provides multiple helpers to easily search within a language based setup (like one core per language in solr).

Aldryn Search allows you to easily setup a search interface to django-cms and/or any Django app.

Aldryn Search is `open-source software <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-search>`_.
